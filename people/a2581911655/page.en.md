## Introduction

Chewing Gum was a trans girl enthusiastic about life.

On Bilibili, she posted recordings of various games, most of which belonged to the vehicle simulation genre, including *World Truck - Driving Simulator*, *Spintires: MudRunner*, and so on.
She also played popular games like PUBG and Genshin Impact.

She had good dexterity and DIYed many electronics.
She also did some mini-experiments.

Her road of discovering what it means to be a girl was filled with inferiority, confusion, and anxiety; yet, she still lived fiercely for a long time, leaving behind many beautiful memories.

Following are some personal photos she left in this world:

## The End of Her Journey

At the end of 2023, she planned a 3-month journey.

During her journey, she went to Guangdong, and got into [Yantian](https://one-among.us/profile/SS3B_0016/)'s Iveco van. She tweeted:

> “It was comfortable to sit on the front passenger-side seat of Yantian's van~”

After that, she went to Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Henan to meet some friends.

On January 18th, 2024, she ended her journey reluctantly, "I won't able to see everyone again until one and a half years later."

But she couldn't fulfill her promise.
Two days later, she attempted to take her life, and now we're separated by life and death.
