## Description

Acheron was a young trans girl who was lovely, brave, and kind-hearted.

She uploaded several Minecraft gameplay videos on Bilibili.
She once excavated an entire chunk in Minecraft with nine friends in the Speedrun community in just 30:17.

Acheron was not just a gamer but also a tech enthusiast.
She was knowledgeable in various aspects of technology,
from hardware to software,
and often shared her insights with the community.
She uploaded two notable videos:
one is unboxing the BearPi-HM Nano development board.
The other is installing Klipper based on Debian 10.

## Departure

Acheron battled depression alone,
never letting her depression affect others.
Everyone who knew her was fond of her.

Despite an unfortunate childhood and a difficult present,
she didn't complain about her experiences online.
She always faced life's challenges with positivity.

But she left us so early that we cannot even see her retreating figure.

In an instant, we were forever separated, as if heaven and earth...
