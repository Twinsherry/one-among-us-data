She knew how to use Tarot for divination. However, according to her friends, she often got bad predictions in divination.

SugarMeow said MioCardMeow was in fact a clingy girl. It was a pity that she couldn't be with her more due to her studies.

## Departure

Her hostile family and the negative impact of long-term medications (pituitary adenoma) gave rise to her suicidal thoughts. She passed away after an unsuccessful resuscitation.

Her departure was reported by [Miao Xiao Bai](https://twitter.com/pizyj/status/1492928433172582400?s=21) on February 14th, 2022.

## After Her Leaving

MioCardMeow had a good friendship with SugarMeow. After her departure, SugarMeow inherited her nickname to remember her.

> I am afraid of forgetting her… I like her a lot. She was lovely, gentle, polite… and she always took care of me…
